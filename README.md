# Description

This is the final project of the Data Analyst training program from Practicum by Yandex.
This Project consists of 3 separate projects:
1. A-B Testing 
2. SQL 
3. Final Project


# A-B Testing Setup

You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

**Note:** See PDF for complete Description


# SQL Setup

The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were at home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers. 

You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

# Final Project Setup


The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness.

- Carry out exploratory data analysis
- Identify ineffective operators
- Test statistical hypotheses
